I was supposed to be paid my last pay(big whopping 7.5 hours of pay) on Friday that just passed, and of course, they didn't pay me and said that'd be another week before I'll get my final check from them. I start at a new job tomorrow but won't be paid until October 4th and that money all goes right into rent. \\n\\nI just would love to eat pizza and watch Breaking Bad tonight as if everything was normal. \"\n",

I THOUGHT I had 20 bucks in my bank but my netflix went through today. I got paid yesterday but the money wont hit my bank account until Tuesday morning because the owners of my place have crappy checks that the bank atm does not recognize.\\nIf someone is gracious enough to reward me I will hold a contest Tuesday to Repay the favor.
